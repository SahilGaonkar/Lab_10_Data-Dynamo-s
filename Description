Plot Design and Rationale

By displaying all variables simultaneously in a grid layout, viewers can compare patterns across different measurements and identify relationships between variables.
The standard boxplot design is enhanced by adding jitter points overlaid on each boxplot. With relatively small sample sizes per month (ranging from 14-31 observations), showing individual data points provides transparency about the actual distribution and density of measurements. The jitter adds horizontal spread to prevent overplotting while maintaining
accurate vertical positioning


What Each Panel Shows:-

 Panel A - Ozone (Air Quality Indicator): 
 Ozone shows dramatic month-to-month variation, with May displaying median values around 18 ppb and July-August reaching 60 ppb—a threefold increase. The jitter points reveal substantial day-to-day
 variability in summer months, with several extreme outliers above 100 ppb representing air quality alert conditions. This panel demonstrates that ozone pollution is distinctly a summer problem, with peak concentrations in mid-summer.

 Panel B - Solar Radiation: 
 Solar radiation remains relatively stable across months compared to other variables, with medians clustering between 180-220 lang. May shows slightly higher median values, which seems counterintuitive until
 considering that clearer spring skies may allow more direct sunlight compared to hazier summer conditions. The jitter reveals moderate day-to-day variability and several low-radiation outliers, likely representing cloudy or rainy days.

 Panel C - Temperature:
 Temperature displays the expected seasonal progression from cool May (median ~67°F) through peak summer July-August (median ~84°F) and back down in September (~77°F). This panel serves as the reference pattern
 because Plots 1-4 already established these temperature trends in detail. The tight clustering of points and few outliers indicates temperature is more consistent day-to-day than other variables.

 Panel D - Wind Speed:
 Wind shows an interesting inverse relationship with temperature and ozone. May displays highest median wind speeds (~12 mph), while summer months show progressively lower values (~9-10 mph). This pattern explains
 part of the ozone accumulation in summer: stagnant air masses trap pollutants. The negative correlation between wind and ozone (r = -0.61) is visually apparent when comparing panels A and D.


Implementation:-

 ggpubr package's ggarrange() function was used to create the 2×2 grid layout. Each panel uses qplot() with geom = "boxplot" for the base visualization, then adds geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.4, size = 1.5) to overlay individual points. The width parameter controls horizontal spread, alpha adds transparency to show overlapping points, and size determines point diameter.

 Month was converted from numeric (5-9) to factor with named levels ("May" through "September") to ensure proper ordering and labeling. Color coding distinguishes months, with only panel A retaining the legend to avoid redundancy. The annotate_figure() function adds an overall title and data source caption that applies to the entire grid rather than individual
 panels.
