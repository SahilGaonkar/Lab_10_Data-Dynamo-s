##  Overview

This repository contains **Lab 10: Data Visualization in R**, a collaborative project by **Team Data Dynamo-s** (MSc Integrated Data Science, Semester V – Data Science Toolkit).  
The objective was to explore and visualize the **airquality** dataset using various R visualization techniques.

Each team member created a unique plot, contributing to a combined report that highlights different aspects of the dataset.

##  Dataset Description

We used the built-in **airquality** dataset in R, which includes daily air quality measurements in **New York (May–September 1973)**.

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Ozone`   | Ozone concentration (ppb) |
| `Solar.R` | Solar Radiation (lang) |
| `Wind`    | Wind speed (mph) |
| `Temp`    | Temperature (°F) |
| `Month`   | Month of measurement |
| `Day`     | Day of measurement |
